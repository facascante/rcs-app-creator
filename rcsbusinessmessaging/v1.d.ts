     * (Optional, only supported on Android Messages clients) Rather than specify a lat_long (and optionally, a label), the agent can instead specify a query string. For default map apps that support search functionality (including Google Maps), tapping this suggested action results in a location search centered around the user&#39;s current location. If the query is sufficiently specific, then agents can use it to select any location in the world.  For instance, setting the query string to &quot;Growing Tree Bank&quot; will show all Growing Tree Bank locations in the user&#39;s vicinity. Setting the query string to &quot;1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043&quot; will select that specific address, regardless of the user&#39;s location.
